Introduction:
 The transition towards electric vehicles (EVs) is reshaping the automotive industry, with a crucial focus on enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Among the various components of an EV, the chassis plays a pivotal role in ensuring vehicle integrity, occupant protection, and structural stability. Selecting the appropriate material for the chassis construction is paramount to meet stringent safety standards and optimize vehicle performance. Machine learning techniques offer a promising avenue to predict the suitability of materials for EV chassis based on their mechanical properties.

Problem Definition: The project endeavors to develop a predictive model to assess the suitability of diverse materials for constructing EV chassis solely based on their mechanical properties. Using a real-world dataset comprising mechanical attributes of different materials and their corresponding labels denoting usability ('Yes' or 'No'), the objective is to train a machine learning model, specifically a Decision Tree Classifier, to predict whether a material is suitable or unsuitable for an EV chassis. The classification task involves identifying materials that meet the requisite mechanical criteria for optimal chassis performance and safety.

Data: The dataset utilized for this project originates from the Autodesk Material Library and encompasses various mechanical properties of machine design materials. It comprises 15 attributes, including Standard, ID, Material Name, Heat Treatment Method, Ultimate Tensile Strength (Su), Yield Strength (Sy), Elongation at Break or Strain (A5), Brinell Hardness Number (BHN), Elastic Modulus (E), Shear Modulus (G), Poisson's Ratio (mu), Density (Ro), Pressure at Yield (pH), and Description of the Material (Desc), along with Vickers Hardness Number (HV). However, only seven features are selected for analysis: ID, Ultimate Tensile Strength, Yield Strength, Youngâ€™s Modulus, Shear Modulus, Poisson's Ratio, and Density, as they are crucial for determining chassis suitability. Additionally, a binary label column ('Use') is added, indicating whether a material is suitable ('Yes') or unsuitable ('No') for an EV chassis based on specific mechanical thresholds.

Material Selection Using Decision Tree: The decision tree algorithm is employed to build the predictive model for material selection in EV chassis construction. The dataset is preprocessed to concatenate relevant columns, remove unnecessary attributes, and define the 'Use' column based on specified mechanical criteria. Subsequently, the decision tree classifier is trained using the selected features (Su, Sy, E, G, mu, Ro) as input variables and 'Use' as the target variable. The decision tree model learns to classify materials as suitable or unsuitable for EV chassis based on their mechanical properties. Visualizing the decision tree enables interpretation of the criteria used by the model to make classification decisions, providing insights into the material selection process for EV chassis construction.
This project underscores the integration of machine learning techniques in automotive engineering to streamline material selection processes, enhance vehicle safety, and drive innovation in the electric vehicle domain.
